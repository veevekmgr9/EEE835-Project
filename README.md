# EEE835-Project
A smart workspace and sleep monitoring system using multiple Arduino MKR 1010 microcontrollers.(one as master and other two as slave)​. Sensors continuously measure temperature, humidity, noise, light, motion, and posture/distance.​ Master boards communicate with others two using MQTT.​The master board provide real-time alerts using LCD display and buzzer.​
This project include alert to user by buzzer when noise level, temperature level and humidity level is too high and posture and control of light during working time and sleeping time.​
The main goal is to help users maintain a healthy, and comfortable environment.
